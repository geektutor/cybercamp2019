					The world as we know it today has evolved exponentially and continues to do so, especially in the
					area of Information Technology. A report from the United States Bureau of Statistics showed that
					Computer occupations made up nearly 45 percent of Science, Technology, and Engineering and
					Mathematics (STEM) employments in the United States in 2015. While it projects employment in
					computer occupations to increase by 12.5 percent from 2014 to 2024, and due to its large employment

      <blockquote>
        <q>I can never forget the moment I built my first game in Cyber Camp, it was a great experience for me. I want my friends and all other kids out there to know that Cyber Camp is a very good program, it will give them ideas and broaden their knowledge about Information Technology. Because of Cyber Camp, I see myself specializing in Game design and development in the future.</q>
