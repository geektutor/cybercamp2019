        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Most Nigerian kids look forward to their long vacation from July – September of every year, it is usually a period to get away from the rigors of academics and to have lots of fun. However, this period can be optimized by ensuring that the young ones have fun while learning new skills.</p>
          <p>Unilag Consult’s Cyber Camp 2019 for teenagers is the second edition of the programme, the initiative was born on the premise and need to capacitate young Nigerians with modern technological skill-sets in selected specializations.</p>
          <p>The world as we know it today has evolved exponentially and continues to do so, especially in the area of Information Technology. A report from the United States Bureau of Statistics showed that Computer occupations made up nearly 45 percent of Science, Technology, and Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) employments in the United States in 2015. <br>While it projects employment in computer occupations to increase by 12.5 percent from 2014 to 2024, and due to its large employment size, this growth is expected to result in nearly half a million new jobs, far more than any other STEM group.</p>
          <p>We intend to adopt a project based (practical) delivery model at impacting the participants with hands-on skills.</p>

                  <p>Cyber camp was a fun, enjoyable and unforgettable experience. The most unforgettable moment for me during the program was the game creation with Unity software. 
  I would like to tell other kids that Cyber Camp is a good way of learning Information Technology and it is the fastest way to get Tech knowledge. 
  I see myself specializing in Web design and development and game design and development in the future.</p>

                  <p>Cyber Camp was a very interesting experience, kids are guaranteed to enjoy themselves if they come for the training. Parents should endeavor to enroll their wards for Cyber Camp because it is a very educational program and their wards will enjoy it and learn a lot of new stuff. I enjoyed the Web design and development project most and I now know how to code. I am also getting better at Game development.</p>
