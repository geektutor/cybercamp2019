        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Most Nigerian kids look forward to their long vacation from July – September of every year, it is usually a period to get away from the rigors of academics and to have lots of fun. However, this period can be optimized by ensuring that the young ones have fun while learning new skills.</p>
          <p>Unilag Consult’s Cyber Camp 2019 for teenagers is the second edition of the programme, the initiative was born on the premise and need to capacitate young Nigerians with modern technological skill-sets in selected specializations.</p>
          <p>The world as we know it today has evolved exponentially and continues to do so, especially in the area of Information Technology. A report from the United States Bureau of Statistics showed that Computer occupations made up nearly 45 percent of Science, Technology, and Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) employments in the United States in 2015. <br>While it projects employment in computer occupations to increase by 12.5 percent from 2014 to 2024, and due to its large employment size, this growth is expected to result in nearly half a million new jobs, far more than any other STEM group.</p>
          <p>We intend to adopt a project based (practical) delivery model at impacting the participants with hands-on skills.</p>
